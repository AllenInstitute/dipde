=================================

.. include:: ../README.md

The population density approach in computational neuroscience seeks to understand the statistical evolution of a large population of homogeneous neurons. 
Beginning with the work of Knight and Sirovich [#]_ (See also [#]_), the approach typically formulates a partial integro-differential equation for the evolution of the voltage probability distribution receiving synaptic activity, and under the influence of neural dynamics.
Neuronal dynamics typically follow from the assumption of a leaky integrate-and fire model. 
We implement a numerical scheme for computing the time evolution of the master equation for populations of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with shot-noise synapses (For a similar approach, see [#]_).

For a Quick Start, you can begin with the :ref:`ref-examples`.

Details on the classes used to define a dipde simulation can be found in :ref:`ref-internals`.
