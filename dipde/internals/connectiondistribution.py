class ConnectionDistribution(object):
    '''Container for matrix that computes element flux, and associated methods.
    
    A ConnectionDistribution object contains a matrix used to compute the time
    propogation of the voltage probability distribution, and a vector used to
    compute the flux over threshold at the end of the timestep. It is unique up
    to the descretization of the target voltage distribution, and the specific
    synaptic weight distribution of the connection.  Therefore, whenever
    possible, a ConnectionDistribution object is reused for multiple connections
    with identical signatures, to reduce memory consumption.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    edges: np.ndarray
        Voltage bin discretization of target population.
     weights: np.ndarray 
        Weights defining the discrete synaptic distribution. 
    probs : np.ndarray
        Probabilities corresponding to weights.
        
    Attributes
    ----------
    self.threshold_flux_vector : np.ndarray
        Vector used to compute over-threshold flux.
    self.flux_matrix : np.ndarray
        Matrix used to propagate voltage distribution.
