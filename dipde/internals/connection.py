class Connection(object):
    '''Class that connects dipde source population to dipde target population.

    The Connection class handles all of the details of propogating connection
    information between a source population (dipde ExtermalPopulation or
    InternalPopulation) and a target population (dipde InternalPopulation).
    Handles delay information via a delay queue that is rolled on each timestep,
    and reuses connection information by using a ConnectionDistribution object
    with a specific signature to avoid duplication among identical connections.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
     source : InternalPopulation or ExternalPopulation
         Source population for connection.
     target : InternalPopulation
         Target population for connection.
     nsyn : int
         In-degree of connectivity from source to target.
     weights : 
         Weights defining synaptic distribution.
     delay: float (default=0) 
         Transmission delay (units: sec).
     metadata: Connection metadata, all other kwargs
