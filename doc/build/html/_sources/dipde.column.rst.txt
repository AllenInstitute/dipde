Cortical Column Model
=========================

:download:`Download potjans_diesmann_cortical_column.py <../dipde/examples/potjans_diesmann_cortical_column.py>`

Potjans and Diesmann [#]_ parameterized a four-layer, two cell-type (i.e excitatory and inhibitory) model of a cortical column. 
Beginning with their detailed model description, we implemented a version of their model using dipde. 
The population statistic approach lends itself to quickly analyzing the mean response properties of population-scale firing-rate dynamics of neural models.
