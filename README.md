DiPDE (dipde) is a simulation platform for numerically solving the time evolution of coupled networks of neuronal populations.
Instead of solving the subthreshold dynamics of individual model leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, dipde models the voltage distribution of a population of neurons with a single population density equation.
In this way, dipde can facilitate the fast exploration of mesoscale (population-level) network topologies, where large populations of neurons are treated as homogeneous with random fine-scale connectivity.
